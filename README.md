# Accident_detection-Using-Deep-learning-

Accidents have been a major cause of deaths in India. More than 80% of accident- related deaths occur not due to the accident itself but the lack of timely help reaching the accident victims. In highways where the traffic is really light and fast-paced an accident victim could be left unattended for a long time. The intent is to create a system which would detect an accident based on the live feed of video from a CCTV camera installed on a highway. The idea is to take each frame of a video and run it through a deep learning convolution neural network model which has been trained to classify frames of a video into accident or non-accident. Convolutional Neural Networks has proven to be a fast and accurate approach to classify images. CNN based image classifiers have given accuracy's of more than 95% for comparatively smaller datasets and require less preprocessing as compared to other image classifying algorithms.
